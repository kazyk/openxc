openxc
======

quick open command for xcodeproj and xcworkspace

- finds .xcodeproj and .xcworkspace from current (or specified) and ancestor directories
- opens .xc~ using OSX "open" command
- .xcworkspace is prior if both exists in same directory
- you can specify application name with "-a" option ("-a AppCode" for example)
